# Open Grant Proposal: `Storage Manager`

**Name of Project:** Storage Manager

**Proposal Category:** `app-dev`

**Proposer:** `edisinovcic`

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** "Yes"

# Project Description

We are building the decentralized GUI tool that will make it easy for the end-users to interact with filecoin.
We are going to build a frontend app deployed to the IPFS that will show interaction with storage functionality in a friendly way.

## Value

- Our project will provide better user experience for general audience and help widespread   Filecoin project
- Risks are low because currently there are no such tools and users have to use cli tools to interact with filecoin
- We need a stable public node for this to work

## Deliverables

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

First implementation will store 3 copies of desired files without splitting. Plan is to research the erasure encoding algorithm to save resources in the future and implement it on frontend. That will provide a more precise recommendation on the number of copies. Also, we will split files larger than 32 GB in chunks in the future also.

## Relevant Experience

We are a team of six with expertise in providing different full-stack blockchain solutions. We are working part time on projects for Ethereum Foundation and ZoKrates as external contributors and have also done grants for Web3 Foundation. We have closely cooperated with Remix, Solidity and ZoKrates teams and are pushing towards more enterprise approaches for tools like IPFS and similar. We believe that decentralization is the key and that it needs to be integrated into standard web2 tools and services and that it will bring more transparency, security and trustworthiness to those systems by forcing collectors of the data to be responsible to the end users.

# Additional Information

Weâ€™ve already tested quite a bit of your platform and have decided to contribute to it by giving you and your users even better UX. Building on ipfs is one of the most interesting areas that we explore now and platforms like filecoin feel like a great match for us.
